### Hi there 👋

My name is Renan, and I'm an iOS and RoR developer.

I've learned how to program through college which I'm still finishing as a Software Engineer major.
I enjoy learning new things and getting to know new and cool techniques.
Nowadays, I like to spend my free time working on my pet projects and writing for raywenderlich.com.

Currently, I'm an iOS developer at Invillia/PagSeguro.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a few pet projects as well as my writing skills.📝✨
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SwiftUI. I really like learning about new and amazing APIs. SwiftUI is the latest UI framework from Apple and much like UIKit, it's awesome.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of iOS app development that helps people.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with DevOps and continuous integration.
- 💬 Ask me about iOS, Swift and RoR development. I also like to talk about different Design Patterns and Architecture Patterns.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me on Twitter @renanbdias or through my email renanbenattidias@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge Pixar/Disney fan.
